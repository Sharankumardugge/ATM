# ATM
🏦 ATM Project 💰

Overview:

This project simulates the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). 🏧 Users can perform various transactions such as withdrawing, depositing, checking balance, and transferring funds. 💸 The project is implemented entirely in Java, utilizing object-oriented programming principles and essential data structures.

Key Features:

User Authentication: 🔒 Users must enter a valid PIN to access the ATM.
Account Management: 🏦 The system maintains a database of user accounts, including account numbers, PINs, and balances.
Transaction Processing: 💰 Users can perform the following transactions:
Withdrawals: 💸 Users can withdraw cash from their accounts, subject to available balance and daily withdrawal limits.
Deposits: 💰 Users can deposit cash or checks into their accounts.
Balance Inquiry: 💰 Users can check their current account balance.
Fund Transfer: 💸 Users can transfer funds between their own accounts or to other accounts.
Error Handling: ❌ The system handles various error conditions, such as invalid PINs, insufficient funds, and network failures.
Logging: 📝 The system logs all transactions and user activity for auditing and security purposes.
Technical Implementation:

Object-Oriented Design: 🏗️ The project is designed using a modular approach with classes representing users, accounts, transactions, and the ATM itself.
Data Structures: 🗄️ The system uses data structures like arrays or lists to store user accounts and transaction history.
Input/Output: ⌨️ The project uses Java's input/output streams to interact with the user through the console.
Error Handling: ❌ Exception handling is implemented to gracefully handle errors and provide informative messages to the user.
